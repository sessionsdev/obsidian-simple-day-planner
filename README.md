![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/sessionsdev/obsidian-simple-day-planner/test?logo=github&style=for-the-badge) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/sessionsdev/obsidian-simple-day-planner?style=for-the-badge&sort=semver)

This repository contains a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for day planning from a list in a Markdown note.  It was forked from James Lynch's [Obsidian Day Planner](https://github.com/lynchjames/obsidian-day-planner) plugin and serves as a simpler implementation.

What does simple mean?
- This plugin shall not mutate the user's notes i.e.,
    - removed automatic completion of tasks
    - removed mermaid gantt chart support
- This plugin shall leverage Obsidian conventions where possible i.e.,
    - updated file mode to utilize a user's [daily note][daily-note] via the Obsidian daily note plugin
    - removed command mode

## Features

- Uses your [daily Obsidian note][daily-note] to generate a day plan.
- Status bar updates on progress with information on your current and next tasks. You can click on the status bar to access the note for today's day planner.
- Timeline view showing your tasks laid out on a vertical timeline.
- Improved support for Obsidian Light and Dark modes with and without translucent backgrounds

## Installing

### Manual installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/sessionsdev/obsidian-simple-day-planner/releases/latest)
1. Extract the `obsidian-simple-day-planner` folder from the zip into your vault's `plugins` folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/`  
Note: On some machines the `.obsidian` folder may be hidden. On MacOS you should be able to press `Command+Shift+Dot` to show the folder in Finder.
1. Reload Obsidian
1. If prompted about Safe Mode, it must be disabled to enable the plugin.

## Usage

Once installed, the plugin will read your daily note to parse and display your plan.

### Daily Note

Within the note, you can create a list of times and tasks which will be automatically be tracked during the day. You can include headings and other content between tasks.  See [examples/day-planner-example.md](examples/day-planner-example.md) for an example.

The format of the task list items is important as this is what is used to calculate the times of each task and the intervals between tasks. The format must be one of:

 ```- HH:mm Task text```
 
 ```- [ ] HH:mm Task text```
 
 **24 hour times must be used.** 

 Nested checklist items or bullets are supported to capture sub-tasks of a timed task. Timed tasks must be at the top level of the checkbox list.

 `BREAK` and `END` are keywords that define breaks and the end to the time tracking for the tasks. They are not case sensitive so `break` and `end` can also be used.

 `END` is used as an item with a time to give an accurate time interval for the last task, *"Prep for tomorrow's meetings"* at 17:00 in this example.

### Timeline View

The `Show timeline` command can be used to add a vertical timeline view to show the tasks for today's plan and a line marking the current time.

### Status Bar

The status bar in Obsidian will show the current progress on the task or break with the time remaining. Clicking on the status bar item will take you to the Day Planner note.

#### Task Status

## Configuration

### Status Bar

#### Circular Progress

You can choose to display progress in the status bar with a circular pie chart progress bar to save horizontal space.

You can choose to display the time and start of the text for the current and next task.

### Task Notification

You can choose to have an in-app notification display when a new task starts.

### Timeline Zoom Level

This is the zoom level to dispaly the timeline. The higher the number, the more vertical space each task will take up.
